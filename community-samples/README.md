## Samples

### The Foodwaste Hack

We want to show you how you can combine Powerapps, Fabric and AI to minimise food waste in your kitchen.

Ever looked into your fridge and thought “darn, should have cooked that chicken sooner?” Worry no more. we have a hack for you.

In our github repo you will find everything you need to create a power app to help track food you have bought, assisted by your own lakehouse with millions of product descriptions, use AI to help with setting expiration dates, and again use AI to recommend some yummy recipe ideas on what to do with your ingredients. The best part? A reflex trigger in Fabric will know when your items are about to go off and automatically trigger your own master chef to suggest some great recipe ideas and email them to you before it is too late!

### Automating synthetic data creation & reporting using Microsoft Fabric

When considering privacy protection in the context of an outsourcing company, synthetic data generation becomes particularly relevant due to the sensitive nature of the data involved. Outsourcing companies often handle data from clients that may contain personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, proprietary business information, and other sensitive data.

By leveraging synthetic data generation techniques, outsourcing companies can effectively manage and mitigate the privacy risks associated with handling sensitive data, thereby building trust with clients, enhancing data security, and ensuring regulatory compliance.
