# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

## Types of Contributions

1. **Documentation Fixes and Feature Samples Improvements:**
   - We welcome pull requests (PRs) for fixes and improvements to existing documentation and feature samples. Whether it's a typo, a bug fix, or a new addition that enhances the utility of a sample, your contribution is valuable to us.

2. **Adding to Fabric Community Samples:**
   - If you have developed a sample that you believe would be beneficial to the Fabric community, please consider submitting it. All community sample additions should be proposed through pull requests. The decision to merge such PRs is at the discretion of our team, ensuring alignment with the project's goals and quality standards.

## Criterias for Community Samples

To ensure the quality and utility of these contributions, we ask that all community samples meet the following criteria:

- **Open Source License:** Each sample must include an open-source license, preferably the MIT License.
- **README File:** Must include a detailed README with a description, setup and deployment instructions, and prerequisites.
- **Deployment Instructions:** Provide clear steps for deploying the sample. You can assume that readers will know how to do basic steps (like creating a workspace or a lakehouse).
- **Code Quality:** Follow best coding practices and Microsoft Fabric coding guidelines.
- **No Sensitive Information:** Ensure no sensitive, personal, or proprietary information is included.
- **Dataset license**: Prefer using an open-source and accessible dataset for your demos. We encourage you to use Fabric built-in sample datasets or [Azure Open Datasets](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/open-datasets/dataset-catalog). If you include your own dataset, please provide an explicite license for this dataset. If your sample needs to leverage a non-open dataset or API, please state this early in your README file.
- **Functionality:** Samples should be fully functional and tested.
- **Adherence to Community Standards:** Contributions must follow the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
