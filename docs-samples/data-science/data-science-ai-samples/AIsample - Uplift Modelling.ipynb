    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll demonstrate the data science work flow with an end-to-end example. The scenario is to create, train and evaluate an uplift model that refers to a collection of machine learning techniques that are employed to estimate the incremental effects of a treatment on an individual or a sub-group behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "The summary of the main steps we take in this notebook are as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and process the data\n",
    "2. Understand the data using exploratory data analysis\n",
    "3. Train a machine learning model using an Uplift model\n",
    "4. Save the final machine learning model\n",
    "5. Load the machine learning model for scoring and making predictions\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Have a lakehouse added to this notebook. We will be downloading data from a public blob, and storing that in the lakehouse. "

    "### What is Uplift Modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Uplift modeling is a set of causal inference techniques that utilize machine learning models to identify the most suitable treatment (from a group of treatments) that leads to the most desirable outcome. This is determined empirically by studying a treatment group (individuals with treatment) and a control group (individuals without treatment). This approach classifies individuals into four main subgroups within a population:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persuadables**: These individuals respond positively only when given the treatment.\n",
    "- **Sleeping-dogs**: This group shows a strong negative response to the treatment.\n",
    "- **Lost Causes**: Individuals in this category will never achieve the desired outcome, even with the treatment.\n",
    "- **Sure Things**: This group will achieve the outcome regardless of whether they receive the treatment or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of uplift modeling is to identify the **\"persuadables\"** since targeting them can lead to a more favorable outcome. Conversely, directing efforts towards the **\"lost causes\"** and **\"sure things\"** groups would be ineffective, and the **\"sleeping dogs\"** group could potentially result in negative outcomes. Uplift modeling finds practical applications in various fields such as marketing, healthcare, and social sciences, where it optimizes decision-making and enhances the effectiveness of interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does Uplift modeling work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main techniques used for uplift modeling include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meta Learner that predicts the difference between an individual's behavior when there is a treatment and when there is not a treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uplift Tree which is a tree-based algorithm that takes information about treatment/control group assignment and information about the response directly into decisions about splitting criterion for a node. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural Network-based Model which usually works with observational data and helps to learn the distribution of a latent variable using deep learning. We use the latent variable to represent the co-founder in the uplift modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does Uplift modeling benefit?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In marketing applications, uplift modeling can help to identify persuadables who can be swayed by the treatment that could be a coupon or an online advertisement.\n",
    "- In medical treatment, uplift modeling can help in comprehending how a particular treatment can affect distinct groups, allowing for optimized target selection to maximize its impact.\n"

Additionally, 0.31% of all users from the treatment group converted (i.e., made a purchase), while only 0.19% of users from the control group did so. As a result, the conversion rate (i.e., made a purchase) for visitors that were users of treatment group is 6.36%, compared to only 5.07% for users of the control group. This means that the treatment can potentially improve the visit rate by about 1% and the conversion rate of visitors by about 1.3%, which is a significant improvement."
