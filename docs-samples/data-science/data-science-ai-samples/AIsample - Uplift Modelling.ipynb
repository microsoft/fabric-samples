Study of both a treatment group - individuals who undergo a treatment - and a control group - individuals who do not undergo that treatment - determines outcome desirability. This approach classifies individuals into four main subgroups within a population:\n","\n","- **Persuadables**: This group of individuals will respond positively only when given the treatment.\n","- **Sleeping-dogs**: This group of individuals will show a strong negative response to the treatment.\n","- **Lost Causes**: This group of individuals will never achieve the desired outcome, even with the treatment.\n","- **Sure Things**: This group of individuals will achieve the outcome regardless of whether they receive the treatment or not.\n","\n","For its primary objective, uplift modeling identifies the **\"persuadables\"**, since a focus on them can lead to a more favorable outcome. Conversely, efforts directed toward the **\"lost causes\"** and **\"sure things\"** groups would become ineffective, and the **\"sleeping dogs\"** group could potentially result in negative outcomes. Uplift modeling finds practical applications in various fields\n","\n","- marketing\n","- healthcare\n","- social sciences\n","- etc.\n","\n","where it optimizes decision-making and it enhances the effectiveness of interventions.\n","\n","### How does Uplift modeling work?\n","\n","The main techniques used for uplift modeling include:\n","\n","- Meta Learner, to predict the difference between an individual's behavior when the individual undergoes a treatment, and when not undergoing a treatment.\n","\n","- Uplift Tree, a tree-based algorithm that combines both treatment/control group assignment information and response information directly into decisions about splitting criterion for a node.\n","\n","- Neural Network-based Model, which usually works with observational data. It uses deep learning to help determine the distribution of a latent variable. The latent variable represents the co-founder in the uplift modeling.\n","\n","### What benefits does Uplift modeling offer?\n","\n","- For marketing applications, uplift modeling can help identify persuadables who can potentially be swayed to try the treatment. The outreach to identify persuadables could involve a coupon or an online advertisement, for example.\n","- For medical treatments, uplift modeling can help measure how a particular treatment can impact distinct groups. This allows for optimized target selection, to maximize the impact.\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}},"id":"58090d36-f361-4a8e-8a93-80fba833a43e"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 1: Load the Data"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}},"id":"10b9dec8-622d-4f6c-8b4c-23dc3505ede9"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Dataset\n","\n","The Criteo AI Lab created the dataset.
