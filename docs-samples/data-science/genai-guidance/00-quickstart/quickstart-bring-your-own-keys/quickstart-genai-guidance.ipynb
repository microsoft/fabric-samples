				"## Introduction\n",
				"\n",
				"Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are powerful tools, but their effectiveness for business applications and meeting customer needs greatly improves when customized with specific data using Generative AI (GenAI) solutions. Without this customization, LLMs may not deliver optimal results tailored to the requirements and expectations of businesses and their customers. \n",
				"\n",
				"One straightforward approach to enhance the results is to manually integrate specific information into prompts. For more advanced improvements, fine-tuning LLMs with custom data proves effective. This notebook demonstrates the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy, which supplements LLMs with dynamically retrieved and relevant information (e.g., business-specific data) to enrich their knowledge.\n",
				"\n",
				"Implementing RAG involves methods such as web searching or utilizing specific APIs. An effective approach is utilizing a Vector Search Index to efficiently explore unstructured text data. The Vector Index searches through a database of text chunks and ranks them based on how closely they match the meaning of the user's question  or query. Since full documents or articles are usually too large to embed directly into a vector, they are typically split into smaller chunks. These smaller chunks are then indexed in systems like Azure AI Search, making it easier to retrieve relevant information efficiently.\n",

				"This tutorial provides a quickstart guide to use Fabric for building RAG applications. The main steps in this tutorial are as following:\n",
				"\n",
				"1. Set up Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search Services\n",
				"2. Load and manipulate the data from [CMU's QA dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/QA-data/) of Wikipedia articles\n",
				"3. Chunk the data by leveraging Spark pooling for efficient processing\n",
				"4. Create embeddings using [Azure OpenAI Services](https://aka.ms/openai-embeddings)\n",
				"5. Create a Vector Index using [Azure AI Search](https://aka.ms/what-is-azure-search)\n",
				"6. Generate answers based on the retrieved context using [OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai-overview)\n",
				"\n",

				"- [Microsoft Fabric](https://aka.ms/fabric/getting-started)\n",
				"- [Add a lakehouse](https://aka.ms/fabric/addlakehouse) to this notebook. You will download data from a public blob, then store the data in the lakehouse resource.\n",

For deploying your own OpenAI models outside of Fabric, [Azure AI Studio for OpenAI](https://aka.ms/what-is-ai-studio) is recommended. Two models are required for RAG: `text-embedding-ada-002` for embedding and `gpt-35-turbo` or a similar chat model. Please provide the specific names and keys for these models in the following.\n",
				"\n",
				"Once done with setting up your Azure OpenAI Service, you need to set up your Azure AI Search which offers a user-friendly interface to create a vector database in Azure. Since you already have an Azure subscription, you can also create an Azure AI Search Service by following the instructions [here](https://aka.ms/azure-ai-search).\n",
				"\n",
				"You may choose a free tier for the Azure AI Search Service, which allows you to have 3 indexes and 50 MB of storage. The free tier is sufficient for this tutorial. You will need to select a subscription, set up a resource group, and name the service. Once configured, obtain the keys to specify as `aisearch_api_key`. Please complete the details for `aisearch_index_name`, etc in the following. \n",

				"In RAG, creating a vector index helps quickly retrieve the most relevant information for user queries. By organizing document chunks into a vector space, RAG can match and generate responses based on similar content rather than just keywords. This makes the responses more accurate and meaningful, improving how well the system understands and responds to user inputs.\n",
				"\n",
				"In the next steps, you will set up a search index in Azure AI Search that integrates both semantic and vector search capabilities. You can begin by initializing the `SearchIndexClient` with the required endpoint and API key. Then, define the data structure using a list of fields, specifying their types and attributes. The `Chunk` field will hold the text to be retrieved, while the `Embedding` field will facilitate vector-based searches. Additional fields like `ArticleTitle` and `ExtractedPath` can be included for filtering purposes. For custom datasets, you can adjust the fields as necessary.\n",
				"\n",
				"For vector search, configure the Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) algorithm by specifying its parameters and creating a usage profile. You can also set up semantic search by defining a configuration that emphasizes specific fields for improved relevance. Finally, create the search index with these configurations and utilize the client to create or update the index, ensuring it supports advanced search operations. \n",
